- 👋 Hi, I’m Jorge Urrea.
- 👀 I’m interested in the computational methods applied to solve Multi-physics problems either modelled by PDEs or ODEs.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning about Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs), Gaussian Processes (GPs), and Finite Element Method (FEM) technologies. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on the development of robust/reliable libraries to computational approximate the solution of couple chemo-thermo-mechanical problems either using traditional methods or machine learning based ones.
